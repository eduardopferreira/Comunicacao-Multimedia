      <div id="initialText">Hello, I am Calcifer! Welcome to my Picnic!
I brought together a set of five plates that you might recognize from the Studio Ghibli Universe, assuming you are a fan of course!
In this magic-filled realm, with such intense stories, there is a special focus on one of the pillars of human joy: FOOD! Many times the narrative of the pictures is overlooked to bring light to the actions of: Cooking and Eating, amazing-looking dishes that fans all over the world wish to try. 
Well! I am here to make it easier. Not only presenting you the food, but also the movie it's from, hoping to raise the urge to go and watch it, the character who cooks the dish (credit to the cooks, always!) and also a list of ingredients and instructions so that you can make them at home, hoping you leave your worries behind and for an instant enjoy the present,
 just like in the movies.
Well, enough rambling, go to the top of the hill and sit with us at Calcifer’s Picnic.
