    <a id="initialText" >Hello, I am Calcifer. Welcome to my Picnic at the hills of mount … . I brought together a set of five plates that you might recognize from the Studio Ghibli Movie Universe, assuming you are a fan of course!
      In this magic and emotion filled universe, with such intense stories, there is a special focus on something, that for us, is one of the pillars of human joy: FOOD! Many times the narrative of the films is completely stopped to bring light to the actions of: Preparing, Cooking and Eating, amazing looking plates that fans all over the world wish they could try. 
      Well, we are here to make it easier for you. We not only present to you, the plates, the movies which they are from, hoping you gain the urge to go and watch them, the character who cooks the dish (of course we need to give credit to the cooks) and we give you a list of ingredients and instructions so you can make them at home, hoping you leave your worries behind and for a brief moment enjoy the present, just like in the movies.
      Well, enough rambling, go to the top of the hill and sit with us at Calcifer’s Picnic.</a>
