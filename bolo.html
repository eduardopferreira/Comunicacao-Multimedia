        This cake was a surprise gift from Madame to Kiki, as a way of appreciation for her sympathy and help. This gift heavily touches Kiki, who was nearly brought to tears upon receiving it. This dessert would bring joy to everyone at our picnic.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>1. You’ll actually want to start with your frosting, since it needs extra time to chill (in fact, you can make the frosting a day ahead of time if you want). First, place your chocolate chips in a large bowl and set aside.</li>
          <br><li>2. Cook the whipping cream and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until just boiling, stirring frequently. Pour the cream mix over the chocolate and whisk briskly until completely smooth.</li>
          <br><li>3. Place some plastic wrap over the bowl and put it in the fridge to chill. After 1 hour, stir the mix thoroughly. Replace the cover and put the mix back in the fridge for another hour or until it reaches spreading consistency.</li>
          <br><li>4. While you’re waiting for the frosting to chill, you can bake your cake! Preheat your oven to 350°. Thoroughly spray a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray or grease it with butter and flour. This cake likes to stick, so be sure to thoroughly coat every nook and cranny.</li>
          <br><li>5. Dump the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Whisk it all up!</li>
          <br><li>6. Whisk in the egg, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla. Beat the mix briskly for 2 minutes.</li>
          <br><li>7. Pour the batter into your pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
          <br><li>8. When fully baked, set the cake pan on a wire rack to cool for 1o minutes. Then flip the cake out of the pan and allow it to cool completely on the rack.</li>
          <br><li>9. When the cake is cool, spread on a layer of chocolate frosting. Let it set for 5-10 minutes.</li>
          <br><li>10. Use a toothpick to draw out where you’ll put the decorative icing. This makes it easier to replicate the look of the cake in the movie. If you make a mistake, just use an icing knife or butter knife to smooth it out.</li>
          <br><li>11. Pipe your decorative icing over the toothpick drawing and allow it to set for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
          <br><li>12. Serve to your favorite little witch to congratulate her on all her hard work!</li>
